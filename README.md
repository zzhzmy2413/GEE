## üìÑ Description

This repository contains:

- A Google Earth Engine (GEE) JavaScript script that  
  1. Loads Sentinel-2 Level-2A surface-reflectance imagery  
  2. Applies cloud and cirrus masking  
  3. Resamples
  4. Computes mean pixel values over sampling sites  
  5. Plots the results as time-series charts  
- Supporting files (e.g. shapefiles or GeoJSON) defining the study regions  
- Instructions to run, customize, and extend the analysis

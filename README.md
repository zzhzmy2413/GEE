Sentinel-2 Cloud-Free Time Series Extraction Using Google Earth Engine:)
This GEE script processes Sentinel-2 surface reflectance imagery for a specified tile and time period. It includes cloud and cirrus masking based on the QA60 band and bilinear resampling of the B8A band to 10m resolution. The final output is a time series chart of mean B8A reflectance over user-defined points or polygons.

ðŸ“Œ Features
1. Cloud and cirrus removal using QA60 bitmasks

2. Resampling of B8A band to 10m resolution

3. Time series chart of reflectance values over user-defined regions

ðŸ›  How to Use
1. Set your study area tile
   Replace the tile code in the line:

   var tiles = ['29UPA']; // Change this to your tile code(s)
2. Upload and use your point or polygon shapefile
   Add your own points or regions to your GEE assets, and update this line accordingly:

   var shp1 = ee.FeatureCollection('projects/minyanaddtionlparameters/assets/10_29UPA');
Example:
    If you uploaded a shapefile of points for tile 33UXP, the path might be:
    'users/your_username/points_33UXP'

3. Run and visualize
    The script will produce a time series chart of mean B8A reflectance for each region in your shapefile.

ðŸ“Š Output
Interactive chart showing reflectance trends over time for each region (FID_ used as series label)

Feel free to modify the band selection, date range, or reducer to suit your study needs:)
